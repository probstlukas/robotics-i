## Exercise Sheet 1

### Exercise 3 (Concatenation of Coordinate Transforms)

What does applying a homogeneous transformation matrix yield, if it contains both a (non-identity) rotation and translation? And what is the effect of multiplying from the left vs. from the right? Visualize the solution of exercise 3 and play around with the parameters using this simple python script. It is an all-in-one file written to be easily understandable, and just requires a very few common python packages (numpy and matplotlib).

### Exercise Sheet 2

#### Exercise 1 (Transformations)

[./exercise_2_1__transformations/](./exercise_2_1__transformations/)

While exercise 1.3 was about applying the transformation, with just the option to try out the effect of performing the calculations differently, this exercise 2.1 is now about systematically investigating
- How a homogeneous transformation matrix is interpreted
- How to convert poses between coordinate systems
- How a transformation applied from the left acts compared to one applied from the right
